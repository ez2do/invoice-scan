# AI DevKit Rules

## Project Context
This project uses ai-devkit for structured AI-assisted development. Phase documentation is located in `docs/ai/`.

## Documentation Structure
- `docs/ai/requirements/` - Problem understanding and requirements
- `docs/ai/design/` - System architecture and design decisions (include mermaid diagrams)
- `docs/ai/planning/` - Task breakdown and project planning
- `docs/ai/implementation/` - Implementation guides and notes
- `docs/ai/deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure docs
- `docs/ai/monitoring/` - Monitoring and observability setup

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow the project's established code style and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions

## Development Workflow
- Review phase documentation in `docs/ai/` before implementing features
- Keep requirements, design, and implementation docs updated as the project evolves
- Reference the planning doc for task breakdown and priorities

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- When implementing features, first check relevant phase documentation
- For new features, start with requirements clarification
- Update phase docs when significant changes or decisions are made

## Documentation
- Update phase documentation when requirements or design changes
- Keep inline code comments focused and relevant
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Use mermaid diagrams for any architectural or data-flow visuals (update existing diagrams if needed)

## Key Commands
When working on this project, you can run commands to:
- Understand project requirements and goals (`review-requirements`)
- Review architectural decisions (`review-design`)
- Plan and execute tasks (`execute-plan`)
- Verify implementation against design (`check-implementation`)
- Perform structured code reviews (`code-review`)
